## Part A - Truth Tables
- We learned how to create quick and easy truth tables by doing $2^n$ where $n$ is the number of inputs. We cut the selection of bits in half for each column. We also were told about the game Turing Complete which is a cool game about building computers yourself, and the opportunity for bonus points.
