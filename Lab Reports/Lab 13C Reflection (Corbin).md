This is an individual assignment related to lab 13 part C.

Submit the following as one pdf file:
Title page mentioning who did you work with as a pair and as a group.

Filled excel sheet. First page is individual, second page should match the page of the person who you worked with in pair, third page should match the group who you worked with.

One page reflection divided into two paragraphs:

     First paragraph mention the justification of the final group prioritization in the excel sheet (you can focus on giving a justification of the highest score for each category). You can work on this paragraph as a group.

    Second paragraph is a reflection on your personality from the perspective of how much your ranking changed from individual to pair to group. You have to write this individually

Please follow the handout and rubric

7. Individually, write a half to one page reflection: 
- In one paragraph, discuss the rationale your group used in the final prioritization scores. 
	- Note anything unique about the application that the specific hardware unit or computing platform that led to key decisions in the prioritization. 

Power is very important in smartphones in general, because of battery life and limitation, so it got a high score in all 3. Area is relatively important as smartphones are small. Graphics cards are designed for as much throughput as possible and parallel processing, which is why they got a high throughput score. Desktops are very large and don't have batteries, so that is why area and power are so low for them. For all processors, latency is an important in factor to consider the speed and efficiency of the entire machine.

- In a second paragraph, discuss how the prioritization scores for the evaluation metrics changed from the individual stage, to the pairwise stage, and finally to the large group stage. 
	- Also discuss how the difference between your scores and the baseline scores changed from the individual step, to the individual stage, to the pairwise stage, and finally to the large group stage. 
	- Essentially, discuss how your scores changed from each step and from the baseline, and why. 
		- This is where you examine how the prioritization scores changed. Did the delta between steps increase, decrease, or not change? Did the delta between your scores and the baseline increase, decrease, or not change?
