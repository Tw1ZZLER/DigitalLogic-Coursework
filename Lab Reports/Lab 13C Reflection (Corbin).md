# 13C Reflection

Power is very important in smartphones and laptops in general, because of battery life and limitation, so the for the processors of these power got the highest score.  For the processor for the desktop, clock period got the highest score, as these processors need to be as fast as possible. Graphics cards are designed for as much throughput as possible and parallel processing, which is why they got a high throughput score on all 3. For the user interfaces, latency got the highest score on all 3, as sluggish and slow user interfaces are often awful to use. 

My score deltas changed from being higher to lower as we went from individual to pairwise to group. This means that I was willing to change my opinion and I was wrong, which is good. One exception was that the desktop components did not change at all, as all 3 of us agreed from pairwise to group on what I did being correct. Additionally, going from individual to pairwise for GPU of laptop went from 0 to 8, and then when we went to group it went back to 0. I think this shows that my partner had a negative effect on that ranking, and it went back to normal after I discussed it with a large group.
