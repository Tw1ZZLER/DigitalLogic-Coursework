## Lab 07 - Priority Encoders
- Lab Conducted: 2024-03-05
- Lab Group Members:
	- Corbin Hibler
	- Dylan Hughes
### Introduction
- In this lab, we practiced creating logic gate diagrams from K-Maps. We worked more on solving the Two High-Bit challenge, from labs 5 and 6. We also tested gate-based 8:3 priority encoders, multiplexor-based 8:3 priority encoders, and two-level 16:4 priority encoders, on our field-programmable gate array (FPGA) development board.

### Procedure
- First we download the 7A-handout
