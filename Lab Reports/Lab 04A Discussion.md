- Compare the results of steps 1, 2, and 3. Are they different? If so, how? 
	- We got the same answers for all three steps.
- What components do we need to implement this algorithm in hardware? 
	- We need a priority encoder, a barrel shifter, a comparator, and an adder. We also need a resistor to store values from previous iterations.
- If a is a negative value, would the algorithm still work? If not, what do we need to change?
	- Represent the numbers in sign and magnitude, find the modulo of the magnitude, add the sign to it, and then add our positive number to make it positive.
