- Using the factors of Promise, Credibility, Differentiator, Price, Risk, and Effort of a value proposition, read through the following case study, and identify how each of these factors apply to you the engineer, and to the company. Use structured text (meaning bullets and/or numbered lists).
- Write a reflection following the analysis section. For grading, see the rubric, briefly described here. Think of this list as a checklist. Do all of the following: 
	- Provide clear and reasonable arguments how each of the 6 factors apply to **you, the engineer.** 
		- Promise
			- As an engineer, I promised to my clients that our product features high-precision floating point accuracy to 17 significant digits, and I would be lying to them if we went through with this.
		- Credibility
			- If I continue to sell this product, and people find out, my credibility will be tanked as an engineer.
		- Differentiator
			- If we sell this product, and no one finds out, I will be well-regarded for my design and I will stand out from the rest.
		- Price
			- If I continue, it will be a lot less money than if we were to delay the project and spend money developing a new chip.
		- Risk
			- If I continue, I am risking my credibility and risking my job if I get fired for this mistake. If I stop and don't sell the chips, I am risking losing reputation with my company.
		- Effort
			- If I continue to sell the chip, it will be a lot less effort than having to develop a new chip and fix the problems with it. If I stop and don't sell the chips, I don't have to focus any more effort on it.
	- Provide clear and reasonable arguments how each of the 6 factors apply to **your company.** 
		- Promise
			- 
		- Credibility
			- 
		- Differentiator

	- Describe a detailed **plan of action** (more than the single sentences provided in the Analysis section). 
	- Identify at least **5 reasonable ramifications** (mix of technical and nontechnical) of your plan of action. 
- Include your reflection in your informal report for Lab 04.
