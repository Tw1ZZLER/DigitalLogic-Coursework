- Using the factors of Promise, Credibility, Differentiator, Price, Risk, and Effort of a value proposition, read through the following case study, and identify how each of these factors apply to you the engineer, and to the company. Use structured text (meaning bullets and/or numbered lists).
- Write a reflection following the analysis section. For grading, see the rubric, briefly described here. Think of this list as a checklist. Do all of the following: 
### Engineer Factors
- Promise
	- As an engineer, I promised to my clients that our product features high-precision floating point accuracy to 17 significant digits, and I would be lying to them if we went through with this.
- Credibility
	- If I continue to sell this product, and people find out, my credibility will be tanked as an engineer.
- Differentiator
	- The high-precision floating-point accuracy distinguishes our chip from competitors, enhancing my professional reputation as an engineer.
- Price
	- If I continue, it will be a lot less money than if we were to delay the project and spend money developing a new chip.
- Risk
	- If I continue, I am risking my credibility and risking my job if I get fired for this mistake. If I stop and don't sell the chips, I am risking losing reputation with my company.
- Effort
	- If I continue to sell the chip, it will be a lot less effort than having to develop a new chip and fix the problems with it. If I stop and don't sell the chips, I don't have to focus any more effort on it.
### Company Factors
- Promise
	- The company has promised to provide 5000 calculators with a high-precision floating point chip that provides accurate calculations up to 17 significant digits.  However due to an error in the tables of values, this will not be true
- Credibility
	- If the error is discovered in the provided products the company's reputation will plummet and will receive less requests.
- Differentiator
	- Since the chip is supposed to be higher precision than others the company will have a better reputation due to providing a better product than competing companies
- Price
	- If more chips sell the company will make more money to produce more products.
- Risk
	- If the chips are sold the company will be risking its reputation and its future buyer's trust
- Effort
	- It would take a lot of effort and money to recall all of the chips for reprogramming.  It would be much cheaper and easier to continue to sell the chips at the risk of the company's reputation.
### Plan of Action
1. Invest resources to rectify the incorrect entries in the firmware tables to ensure accurate floating-point operations.
2. Transparently communicate the discovered issue to customers who have received beta units and delay the shipment of the 5000 manufactured calculators until the problem is resolved.
3. Recall the beta units already shipped to key customers and offer replacements with corrected chips. Similarly, recall the 5000 manufactured calculators and replace them with corrected versions.
4. Provide reassurance to customers about the company's commitment to quality and accuracy, along with a clear plan for rectifying the issue. We can also give them coupons or vouchers for future products.
5. Conduct a review of the development and testing processes we use to develop chips, so we can identify gaps and prevent similar issues in future projects.

### Ramifications:

1. **Financial Loss:** The recall and replacement process will incur significant financial costs for the company.
2. **Reputational Damage:** Failure to address the issue promptly and transparently may result in reputational damage and loss of customer trust.
3. **Delayed Time-to-Market:** Rectifying the problem will delay the release of the product to market, potentially impacting revenue projections.
4. **Competitive Disadvantage:** Competitors may capitalize on the company's misstep, gaining a competitive advantage in the market.
5. **Employee Morale:** The pressure to release the flawed product may impact employee morale and confidence in company leadership.
