1. Is $N$ close to $N_{actual}$? 

For most of the answers, yes they are close, within about 10% error. However, in the middle row, $E$ resulted in overflow, meaning we did not get an $N$ or $N_{actual}$ 

2. What could we do to improve the accuracy? 



3. How can we change the hardware description to support higher precision for the reciprocal?
