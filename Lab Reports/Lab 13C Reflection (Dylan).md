## Reflection
#### Group Reasoning
Power is very important in smartphones and laptops in general, because of battery life and limitation, so the for the processors of these power got the highest score.  For the processor for the desktop, clock period got the highest score, as these processors need to be as fast as possible. Graphics cards are designed for as much throughput as possible and parallel processing, which is why they got a high throughput score on all 3. For the user interfaces, latency got the highest score on all 3, as sluggish and slow user interfaces are often awful to use.
